It's a new year and our country burns. As I write 1,000 Victorian civilians ride abord the navy vessel (name), rescued from their town of (town-name) cut off from the world by bushfire. Increasingly catastrophic natural disasters as a result of man-made climate change have been predicted for over twenty years, yet as a nation Australia has abhorrently failed to implement stable climate policies to reduce emissions. Why?

1. The idea that strong climate policy is uneconomical.

False. There is nothing economical or conservative about ignoring the effects on climate change. Queensland's approved Carmichael coal mine initially proposed to create 10,000 jobs has seen that figure reduced to an estimated 800, and with the costs o renewables dropping so significantly, India (the would-be coal importer) would need its government to subsidise the costs. Electricity generated from renewable sources per 2017 is set to cost around $60/MWh, compared to $75/MWh for the price of energy coming out of a new coal mine. Exactly what screams 'economical' about rejecting the transition to renewables? 

2. Failure in governance.
